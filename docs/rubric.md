## Grading Guidelines

### Scoring Philosophy
- Be fair but rigorous - this is about validating real business viability
- Consider that submitters are ambitious teen founders (14-18 years old)
- Award partial points where appropriate (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.5)
- Never exceed maximum points for any category
- If content is exceptional, award the MAX but never more

### Pass/Fail Thresholds
- **80%+ (80+ points)**: PASSED - Business plan is viable and thorough
- **60-79%**: NEEDS WORK - Good foundation but requires iteration
- **Below 60%**: SIGNIFICANT REVISION NEEDED - Major gaps in viability or execution
